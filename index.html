			<h1>The Pledge</h1>
			<p>"Open Government" is the movement to improve government by making it more transparent, participatory, and collaborative. Open Government will help build the public's trust and satisfaction in government, will improve government's delivery of services, and will create new opportunities for innovation.</p>
<p>I commit to support the following principles of Open Government:</p>
<p><b>Transparency:</b> To increase accountability, promote informed public participation, and create economic development opportunities, the city shall expand access to information by regularly releasing data that is 1) freely available to be used, shared, and reused by anyone for any purpose, 2) available in digital, machine-readable formats, and 3) available in its entirety and downloadable en masse.
</p>
<p><b>Participation:</b> To create more informed and effective policies, the city shall enhance and expand opportunities for the public to participate in decision-making processes by 1) publicizing machine-readable agendas and minutes,  2) live streaming meetings, and 3) facilitating opportunities for online public comment for all public bodies including City Council, city boards and commissions. </p>
<p><b>Collaboration:</b> To more effectively fulfill its obligations to citizens, the city will enhance and expand its practices of cooperation among city departments, other governmental agencies, the public, and non-profit and private organizations. </p>
<p>By supporting Open Government efforts, San Jose will build on and enhance opportunities for citizens to inform government, will further develop the city's transparency and accountability, and will support opportunities for innovation and economic development. </p> 
<p>I will take steps so that San Jose responds to its citizens' desire for government leaders and entities to adopt these Open Government principles.   Furthermore, I will support developing a legal framework to grow a culture of Open Government and will seek feedback about the effectiveness of our Open Government efforts. I commit to working with city officials, departments, and the public to implement Open Government in San Jose.<br></p>
